# Meowth Translator

This app is designed to help Team Rocket agents work on their Meowth-speak.

Documentation for its behavior can be found publicly here: http://cpl.mwisely.xyz
To verify that the code works properly, compare its behavior with the [reference implementation](http://cpl.mwisely.xyz/hw/10/demo.html).

## Using the App

Type in the text box to translate a string to Meowth-speak.
Note that only letters (upper and lower case) and the space character are allowed.
No numbers; no punctuation.

## Writing your app

We recommend using Elm's online editor (<http://elm-lang.org/try>) to develop your program.

You could also install Elm yourself.
Just make sure it's version 0.18.

## Check and Correct Style

Refer to [Elm's style guide](http://elm-lang.org/docs/style-guide) to make sure your code looks good.

There is no automated style checker this time.
You are still responsible for using proper style.
